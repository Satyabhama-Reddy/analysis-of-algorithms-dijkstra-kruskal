# analysis-of-algorithms-dijkstra-kruskal
In this project, different routing algorithms to solve the Max-Bandwidth-Path problem have been implemented. These include Dijkstra’s algorithm with and without using a heap structure and Kruskal’s algorithm using heap sort. An improved Kruskal’s algorithm is also proposed and implemented. The algorithm running times are compared for randomly generated sparse and dense graphs.
