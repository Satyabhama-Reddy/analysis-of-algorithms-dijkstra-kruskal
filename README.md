Maximum Bandwidth Problem using Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithms

Python Version Used: Python 3.8.9

## Code Files Structure:

main.py : Main program to run the test

Graph.py : Implements the adjacency list structure

RandomGraphGenerator.py : Random Graph generation algorithms for G1 and G2

MaxHeap.py : Implements the MaxHeap structure used in Dijkstra_v2

Dijkstra_v1.py : Implements Dijkstra's algorithm without heap for maximum bandwidth problem

Dijkstra_v2.py : Implements Dijkstra's algorithm with MaxHeap for maximum bandwidth problem 

HeapSort.py : Implements Min Heap Sort which is used in Kruskal

Kruskal.py : Implements Kruskal's algorithm with HeapSort for maximum bandwidth problem

Kruskal_Improved.py : Implements Improved Kruskal's algorithm using buildHeap and popMax for maximum bandwidth problem. the heap structure and functions are also defined within the same file
